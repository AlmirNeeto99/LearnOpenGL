- Name: Colored specular mapping

- Description: Add something they call an emission map which is a texture that stores emission values per fragment. Emission values are colors an object may emit as if it contains a light source itself; this way an object can glow regardless of the light conditions. Emission maps are often what you see when objects in a game glow
